# Google Maps Simple Clone

This project is a simple Google Maps clone built using React. The main feature of this application is to calculate and display the distance between the origin and destination. It utilizes the Gomaps Pro API, which is an integration of Google Maps, to avoid the complex billing procedures of directly using the Google Maps API key.

## Features

- **Distance Calculation**: Input the origin and destination, and the app will display the distance between the two locations.
- **React Frontend**: Built using React for the frontend UI.
- **Gomaps Pro Integration**: The app leverages the Gomaps Pro API for distance calculation, which simplifies the use of Google Maps services.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Gomaps Pro**: API integration to fetch the distance between locations.
- **ChatGPT**: Assisted in generating the UI code for the app.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install` in the terminal.
3. Obtain your own API key from Gomaps Pro and set it up in the application.
4. Run the app locally using `npm start` to view it in the browser.
5. Input the origin and destination, and the app will show the distance between the two.

## Future Updates

This project is built as a fun learning exercise, and I plan to extend it with a backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB) in the future to add additional features such as user authentication, saving location data, and more.

Stay connected for updates!
